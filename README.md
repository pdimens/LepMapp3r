#### Interactive bash wrapper for using LepMap3 to create linkage maps
LepMapp3r is a wrapper for LepMap3 [(Rasta 2017)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/23/3726/4061277) intended to link the modules together into a single workflow. To use it correctly, LepMap3 and LepMapperQA.r needs to be installed in `/bin/LM3`, however you can always modify LepMapp3r to point to where your installation is by editing Lines `173` and`267`. LepMapp3r is made for convenience, but it is **not** a replacement for reading the docs and learning how to use LepMap3 correctly. Find the LepMap3 wiki [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/lep-map3/wiki/LM3%20Home/#lep-map3-documentation).

### Installation
An simple installation script script has been provided to download and install `LepMap3`, `LepMapp3r`, and `LepMapp3rQA` onto a system in the correct `$PATH`.

#### Requirements
- `GNU parallel`
- `Java` (for LepMap3)
- `git` for cloning the repo (can also download it manually!)
- `wget`
- `awk`
- `R`
- `sudo` privileges (but installation and scripts can be modified!)

#### Basic system-wide installation
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pdimens/LepMapp3r.git
cd LepMapp3r && chmod +x LM3.install.sh
./LM3.install.sh
```

## LepMapp3r workflow
`ParentCall2` -> `SeparateChromosomes2` -> `JoinSingles2ALL` -> `OrderMarkers2` -> Trimming Ends -> `OrderMarkers2`

By default, if you run LepMapp3r without arguments it will start at `ParentCall2` and work through until the end. Ordering markers may take a while, so it is recommended to run LepMapp3r in a `screen` environment. LepMapp3r creates several folders during operation, and for safety, it is made to identify if these folders exist so as to skip that step and not overwrite data. 

## Usage
To use LepMapp3r, simply run the command with no arguments.
```
LepMapp3r
```
Running `LepMapp3r` with any arguments e.g. `help` `-h` `--help` `potato` `axolotl` will invoke the help text.

### Be aware
LepMap3 is a **very** comprehensive software, and LepMapp3r cannot (will not?) incorporate all the features and nuances within the various modules. Your study is unique, so you are encouraged to fork this repo and adapt LepMapp3r to your needs! All of the code in LepMapp3r is written cleanly in human-readable bash, so give it a shot and adapt it to your workflow. If using LepMapp3r and publishing, cite **Pasi Rastas** for his work on LepMap3, and if you like using it, give Pavel Dimens a shout out on Twitter [@pvdimens](https://twitter.com/PVDimens) [![alt text](http://i.imgur.com/wWzX9uB.png)](https://twitter.com/PVDimens)  =)
