#### Interactive bash wrapper for using LepMap3 to create linkage maps
LepMapp3r is a wrapper for LepMap3 [(Rastas 2017)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/23/3726/4061277) intended to link the modules together into a single workflow. To use it correctly, LepMap3 and LepMapperQA.r needs to be installed in `/bin/LM3`, however you can always modify LepMapp3r to point to where your installation is by editing Lines `184` and`282`. LepMapp3r is made for convenience, but it is **not** a replacement for reading the docs and learning how to use LepMap3 correctly. Find the LepMap3 wiki [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/lep-map3/wiki/LM3%20Home/#lep-map3-documentation).

### Requirements
#### For installation
- `sudo` privileges (but installation and scripts can be modified!)
- `git` for cloning the repo (can also download it manually!)
- `wget`

#### For running
- `GNU parallel`
- `Java` (for LepMap3)
- `awk`
- `R` (uses `Dplyr`, will autoinstall if not present)
- `screen` (optional but strongly encouraged)

### Installation
A simple installation script script has been provided to download and install `LepMap3`, `LepMapp3r`, and `LepMapp3rQA` onto a system in the correct `$PATH`. Intended for Unix-like systems, e.g. Linux. BSD, macOS.

### Before you begin
Please read through [the LepMap3 manual](https://sourceforge.net/p/lep-map3/wiki/LM3%20Home/#lep-map3-documentation). You will need to create a pedigree file from your data and have your filtered VCF file ready to go in the working directory.

## Usage
To use LepMapp3r, simply run the command with no arguments.
```
LepMapp3r
```
Running `LepMapp3r` with any arguments e.g. `help` `-h` `--help` `mango` `American democracy is crumbling` will invoke the help text.

### Be aware
LepMap3 is a **very** comprehensive software, and LepMapp3r cannot (will not?) incorporate all the features and nuances within the various modules. Your study is unique, so you are encouraged to fork this repo and adapt LepMapp3r to your needs! All of the code in LepMapp3r is written [more or less] cleanly in human-readable bash, so give it a shot and adapt it to your workflow. If using LepMapp3r and publishing, cite **Pasi Rastas** for his work on LepMap3, and if you like using it, give Pavel Dimens a shout out on Twitter [@pvdimens](https://twitter.com/PVDimens) [![alt text](http://i.imgur.com/wWzX9uB.png)](https://twitter.com/PVDimens)  =)
